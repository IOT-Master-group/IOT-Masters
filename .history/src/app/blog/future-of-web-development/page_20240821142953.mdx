## 1. AI Assisted Development

With the launch of Github Copilot in 2022 the industry got its first glimpse at what it would look like to have Stack Overflow plumbed straight into your IDE. Copilot has given thousands of developers what they always longed for: plausible deniability over the bugs they write.

In 2023 we can expect these assistants to become more sophisticated and for that to have ripple effects throughout the industry.

We predict that traffic to MDN will decline precipitously as developers realise they no longer need to look up JS array methods. We also expect Stack Overflow’s sister site, Prompt Overflow, to become one of the most popular sites on the internet in a matter of months.

## 2. Rendering Patterns

To server render or not to server render? In 2022 the owners of the internet, Vercel, decided that instead of making this choice once for your whole application, now you will need to decide every time you write a new component.

Because front-end development was becoming too easy, the same people who write CSS will now need to know how Streaming SSR and Progressive Hydration work.

In 2023 we can expect frameworks to adopt increasingly granular rendering patterns culminating in per-line rendering (PLR) later this year. We can also expect job postings for Rendering Reliability Engineers to reach an all time high.

## 3. JS Runtimes

Because choosing a JS runtime was one of the only areas where a developer wasn’t paralysed with choice, in early 2020, the creator of Node gave us something new to agonise over. The launch of Deno and Bun heralded the final mutation of JavaScript into a language that can truly run anywhere it wasn’t intended to.

These new JS runtimes mean we can now serve HTML faster than ever before. For example, we’ve reduced the Time to First Byte (TTFB) of this blog to -0.4s. That means it actually loaded before you clicked the link.

In 2023 we can expect even faster and more specialised JS runtimes to launch, including the promising Boil, a runtime specifically designed to reduce cold boot times on WiFi enabled kettles. All of these advancements promise to make the future of botnets a truly exciting one.

## 1. Machine Learning Evolution

Machine Learning has become a cornerstone of modern technology, driving innovation in various fields from healthcare to finance. As algorithms become more advanced and data more abundant, the potential for ML applications continues to expand.

![](./pilot.jpg)

In the coming years, we can expect ML models to become more efficient, with a greater emphasis on explainability and ethical AI. This will open new avenues for research and practical applications in industries previously untapped by machine learning.

## 2. Deep Learning Breakthroughs

Deep Learning, a subset of Machine Learning, has made remarkable strides, particularly in areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. With the development of more powerful neural networks, the scope of what deep learning can achieve continues to grow.

![](./pilot.jpg)

Looking forward, deep learning models will likely become more accessible, allowing smaller companies and individual developers to leverage these technologies without needing massive computational resources. This democratization of deep learning will lead to rapid innovation and a proliferation of new applications.

## 3. Data Engineering Challenges

Data Engineering plays a crucial role in the success of ML and DL projects by ensuring that the right data is available, clean, and ready for use. As data volumes increase, so do the challenges associated with managing, processing, and securing it.

![](./pilot.jpg)

The future of data engineering will involve more automation and the use of AI to manage data pipelines, ensuring that data is handled efficiently and securely. Additionally, there will be a greater focus on real-time data processing to support the growing need for instant insights in various applications.
